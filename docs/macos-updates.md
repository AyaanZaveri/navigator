# macOS app updates

Navigator uses Sparkle 2.10.1 for macOS updates. Sparkle checks a fixed HTTPS feed,
shows its native update window, verifies the archive, replaces Navigator and
relaunches it. The app does not accept update URLs or file paths from JavaScript.

## User controls

Settings → About has a manual check button and a background-check switch.
When automatic checks are enabled, the native shell probes on launch and every
hour with Sparkle's information-only API. The check shows no update window and
downloads no archive. The header shows an “Update available” button immediately
left of the avatar only after Sparkle finds an eligible update. Clicking it
opens Sparkle directly, without visiting Settings. The user confirms the download
and chooses when to install and restart.

Web shows the app version and GitHub release button. It shows no desktop
update message or native update controls.

Playback and the owned local server stop before Sparkle continues a relaunch.
The app keeps its bundle identifier and user-data location, so updates do not
replace sign-in data or settings.

## First installation

Versions through 0.5.2 have no Sparkle framework or macOS update key. Users must
manually install the first build with this feature. Later signed releases can
update that build through Sparkle. Install Navigator in Applications before
using in-app updates. Sparkle handles write permissions and app translocation.

Archive signatures do not replace Apple Developer ID signing or notarization.
The current app uses an ad hoc signature. Gatekeeper approval can still be
required for the first manual installation.

## Trust and packaging

`scripts/fetch-sparkle.mjs` pins the official SDK archive and framework hashes.
Packaging copies Sparkle to `Contents/Frameworks` with symlinks intact. It keeps
the framework's existing nested signatures and signs the outer app. The
framework license is included in the package.

The public key is in `desktop/macos/update-public-key.txt`. Its private key
stays in the login Keychain under account `app.navigator.desktop.sparkle`.
Never export it to the repository or release artifacts. Do not generate a new
key for each release. An ad hoc app cannot rely on Developer ID for key rotation.

The native updater checks the bundle's feed URL and public key before starting.
The feed is `updates/macos.xml` on GitHub main. The initial feed is empty until
the first signed macOS release is published.

## Release steps

1. Update package, Cargo and bundle versions together. Use the same release
   version and tag on both platforms.
2. On macOS, run `NAVIGATOR_RELEASE_TAG=release-vX.Y.Z npm run desktop:package`.
   Packaging produces `Navigator-X.Y.Z-macos-arm64.zip` and a signed appcast.
   It uses the Keychain key. A normal local package without this variable does
   not sign an update feed or publish anything.
3. Verify the package version, framework signatures, archive integrity and
   update signature. Run the basic update checks below.
4. Upload the immutable ZIP and signed appcast to that GitHub release. A DMG
   can also be offered for manual installation. Do not alter the ZIP after signing.
5. Verify the uploaded sizes and hashes, then publish the release.
6. Copy the generated appcast to `updates/macos.xml` and push it only after
   the archive's public download URL works. Never advertise a draft release.

To sign an existing release ZIP:

```sh
node scripts/macos-update-feed.mjs \
  dist/Navigator-X.Y.Z-macos-arm64.zip X.Y.Z release-vX.Y.Z \
  dist/Navigator-X.Y.Z-macos-arm64-appcast.xml
```

The tool checks the archive's bundle version, app identifier and public key.
It verifies the resulting signature against the public key before writing the
feed. It rejects a different platform, release tag, signing key or modified bytes.

Basic checks:

```sh
node scripts/test-app-updates.cjs
node scripts/test-macos-update-feed.mjs
node scripts/test-windows-update-feed.mjs
cargo check --manifest-path desktop/Cargo.toml --locked
rustc --edition 2024 --test desktop/src/macos_updater/status.rs -o /tmp/navigator-update-status-tests
/tmp/navigator-update-status-tests
```

The user performs hands-on update, relaunch and playback checks. No new release
is published as part of adding this integration.
